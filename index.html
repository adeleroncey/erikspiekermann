        <h1 class="title">FF Real</h1>
        <p class="typefaces"> Erik Spikermann designed this font in collaboration with Ralph Oliver du Carrois. In 2017, both designers created styles for families FF Real Head and FF Real Text expanding to a total of 52 styles with newly designed italics. FF Real Text is a typeface designed with a large x-height with open counters and a slightly structured character. It is available in 13 finely graded weights, from Hairline to Black. Erik Spiekermann not only produced his font digitally, but also had it cut into wood at a size of 16 cicero.

        <h2 class="title">FF Meta</h2>
        <p class="typefaces"> Initially released as a commercial font in 1991 by Spiekermann's company FontFont, FF Meta is a sans serif typeface family composed of over sixty fonts. The design has the requirement to not be confused with Helvetica. Part of the original demand was to produce a typeface that could be printed almost anywhere without extra typesetting and low printing costs. In 1992, they released a second version of FF Meta called FF Meta 2 Family and until 1998 released variations into FF Meta Family such as FF Meta Normal to FF Meta Black which are each available in roman, italic, small caps and italic small caps.

        <h3 class="title">FF Unit</h3>
        <p class="typefaces">
          Originally conceived as a variant of FF Meta and as the house typeface for Spiekermann’s “United Designer” studio, FF Unit became a distinct family. FF Unit is available in seven weights, from Thin to Ultra, each accompanied by the corresponding italic. In addition to the sans serifs, Spikermann creates two extra variant styles FF Unit Slab, which include seven different weights and their italic versions , and FF Unit Rounded, with rounded terminals individually adapted for overall warm and playful characters.  FF Unit have compact and more squat characters with forms based on superellipse similar to a modern square sans. He abandoned the oblique finials he had in FF Meta. FF Unit is available in seven weights, from Thin to Ultra, each accompanied by the corresponding italic.

        <h4 class="title">ITC Officina</h4>
        <p class="typefaces">
          The ITC Officina Super Family was designed by Erik Spiekermann and Ole Schäfer and published by ITC. Erik Spiekermann first conceived of the ITC Officina typeface design in the early 1980s. Its original intention was to create a family of type that is suitable for office correspondence and business documentation however its use was far beyond that intention. IT Officina offers five different weights in both the Serif and Sans Serif versions with corresponding italics. Its intention was to create a family of type that is suitable for office correspondence and business documentation. ITC Officina is legible at small sizes perfect for documents because of its strong serifs and full counters. It also has an economical use of space with its condensed font design.
